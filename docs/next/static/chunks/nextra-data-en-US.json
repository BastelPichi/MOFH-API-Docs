This is less than ideal, but it is what it is.\nTo do proper error handling, you would have to get the text inside the <status></status> tags to get the status of your request (either 0 or 1). Or, if you use the getuserdomains.php and getdomainuser.php endpoints, you will see that it just returns null instead of the list/array it usually gives.\nMore in-depth error messages will be added soon™️."}},"/":{"title":"Introduction","data":{"":"Welcome to the MyOwnFreeHost (MOFH) API Documentation. This documentation is unofficial and provided by Robert S and contributors.If you find any errors throughout this API reference or know of any API endpoints or wrappers that aren't listed, please make an issue on the GitHub repository or join the iFastNet Community Discord server and ping Roberto#1762.There are examples in cURL and Python, but if you know any other programming language and are willing to contribute please consider making a pull request on the GitHub repository.MOFH API wrappers:\nmofh-client (PHP)\nmofh (Python)\nmofh-client-js (JS)\nmofh-client (JS)\nmofh-net-api (.NET)\n\n\nSide-notes\nYou can create up to 3 accounts per person with the MOFH API. You may be able to create more accounts, but this is not advised and when I asked the iFastNet team they said that there was a limit of 3 accounts per person.\nThe MOFH API is pretty limited, so you can't really do more than what is listed here without doing some trickery and whatnot.\nThe SSL certificate on https://panel.myownfreehost.net/xml-api/ tends to expire, so you may need to turn off SSL verification.\nYou can use both https://panel.myownfreehost.net/xml-api/ and https://panel.myownfreehost.net:2087/xml-api/ to access the API, but on the latter the SSL certificate is practically guaranteed to be expired.\nEvery request returns a 200 OK status code, even invalid requests. You need to check the response body to see if the request was successful or not.\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let's get started, shall we?"}},"/initial-setup/callbacks":{"title":"Callbacks","data":{"":"The MyOwnFreeHost API allows you to set up a callback URL that will be called when a user accounts gets activated, suspended or unsuspended, or when an SQL cluster gets added to a user.
